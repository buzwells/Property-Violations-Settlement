# .Rprofile allows an RStudio user to customize a project workspace by, for
# example, setting environmental variables or loading common libraries.
# RStudio automatically runs the commands in .Rprofile when a project is
# opened.
# 
# To preserve the maximum flexibility for team members to individualize their
# profiles, the alternative shown below is to externalize the common settings
# to a shared configuration file, which team members have the option of simply
# adding to their personal .Rprofile file. The common configuration file could
# be checked in, but the .Rprofile file would be "ignored" for git purposes.
